# Proposed Changes to EE-231 Digital Logic Design

## Background
1. DigitalLogicDesign
1. Computer Architecture
1. 

## missing
1. tri-state
1. bus time-multiplexing
1. bus receivers
1. latches
1. bidirectional buffers
1. A/D conversion
1. D/A

## Group projects

1. Add 4 weekly labs going to 10
1. Requirement: TA must sign off that circuit works, picture taken and submitted
1. People work in pairs for non-ABET labs.
1. ABET subset assessment
1. Pre-work: read, pre-design,...
1. Remove requirement for pre and lab reports

## Homeworks

## Labs

All labs students must draw schematic (modelsim?)
Altium? learning curve
Homework: draw schematic in Altium

10% bonus for good practices (color coding, low wires)
Submission for labs
  picture of circuit
  schematic drawn to point where someone could build it
1. First lab: learn to use scope, logic analyzer
   ???
   a. Search for a 555 timer, build the circuit
   b. Troubleshooting guide
   c. find the frequency and duty cycle of this circuit.

1. Each group builds one register with a physical address
   hex inverter, 7404
   ribbon cable
   TA comes over with ribbon cable, sets address
1. Design a 1Hz clock using 555 timer, high frequency and divider
   Make yellow light blink every 5 seconds, green every 8 seconds



1. Build 2, 4-bit registers
   4 LEDs, 4 switches, set register with set button
   
1. Design a...

1. Intermediate challenge easier than traffic light
1. Something with a bus?
1. 2-4 devices, each 1 bit, each either writes or high Z. address bus selects 

## For other classes
A/D converter
motor control
Design a Tesla Motor controller 480V, 1000A
build an H-bridge with N and P type MOSFETs use high-Z to set gate high?

HW:
1. Write an 64-bit ALU with add, subtract, and, or, xor, ...
1. Write a 16 register multiplexer, each register 64-bits read/write
1. Write a bus where pc requests read/write, each device is read/write or high z
